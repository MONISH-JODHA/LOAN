# LOAN
A loan calculator is a tool that helps individuals or businesses estimate the cost of a loan, including the monthly payment amount, total interest paid, and the total repayment amount. It allows users to input specific loan details, such as the loan amount, interest rate, loan term, and any additional fees or charges. Based on this information, the calculator performs calculations to provide an estimate of the loan repayment schedule.

The key elements typically included in a loan calculator are:

1. Loan Amount: The total amount of money borrowed.

2. Interest Rate: The annual interest rate charged on the loan.

3. Loan Term: The duration of the loan in months or years.

4. Additional Fees: Any extra charges or fees associated with the loan, such as origination fees or closing costs.

Using this information, the loan calculator generates outputs such as:

1. Monthly Payment: The estimated amount the borrower needs to repay each month, including principal and interest.

2. Total Interest Paid: The total amount of interest that will be paid over the course of the loan.

3. Total Repayment Amount: The sum of the loan amount and the total interest paid.

Loan calculators are commonly found on financial websites or included as features in mobile apps. They are useful for individuals or businesses to plan their loan repayment strategy, compare different loan options, and determine the affordability of a loan before taking it out.
